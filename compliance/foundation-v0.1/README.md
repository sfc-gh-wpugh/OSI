# OSI Compliance Test Suite — Foundation (`osi_version: "0.1"`)

**Targets only the Foundation proposal at
[`../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md`](../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md)
(`osi_version: "0.1"`) and its companion
[`SQL_EXPRESSION_SUBSET.md`](../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/SQL_EXPRESSION_SUBSET.md)
(`OSI_SQL_2026` default dialect).**

The Foundation is the deliberately narrow first-cut of OSI semantics:
two query shapes, implicit home-grain aggregation, window functions,
and a small deferred-features list — pinned by 33 numbered Conformance
Decisions (D-001 … D-033) in Appendix B of the Foundation spec, and
the error code index in Appendix C.

Features outside the Foundation surface (LOD grain modes, filter
context, named filters, semi-join filter form, per-metric joins,
non-equijoins, etc.) are listed in §10 of the proposal and exercised
here **only** as negative tests that expect
`E_DEFERRED_KEY_REJECTED` (D-009).

The runner harness lives at [`../harness/`](../harness/) and is
shared with every future per-version suite under `compliance/`.

## Quick start

```bash
# From the repo root
pip install -e compliance/harness
pip install -e compliance/foundation-v0.1
pip install -e impl/python

cd compliance/foundation-v0.1

# Run the full suite against the bundled osi_python adapter.
# Per-run artifacts (summary.md, failures.csv) land in results/latest/
# by default; the curated results/REPORT.md baseline is never touched.
python -m harness.runner \
  --adapter adapters/osi_python_adapter.py \
  --tests tests/ \
  --datasets datasets/

# Run a single area — choose a sibling subdirectory of results/ so it
# doesn't clobber results/latest/
python -m harness.runner \
  --adapter adapters/osi_python_adapter.py \
  --tests tests/bridge/ \
  --datasets datasets/ \
  --output results/bridge

# List discovered tests without running
python -m harness.runner --list --tests tests/
```

The harness ships under [`../harness/`](../harness/) and is installed
as the `osi_compliance_harness` package — every per-version suite under
`compliance/` shares this one runner / reporter / DB manager.

## Per-test layout

Each test is a folder containing:

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `metadata.yaml` | `id: T-NNN`, `decision: D-NNN`, `spec_refs`, `required_features`, `expected_error_code`, `xfail_reason` (if applicable). |
| `model.yaml` | The semantic model (typically a thin wrapper around a fixture from `datasets/f_*`). |
| `query.json` | The semantic query, in the new two-shape format (`Aggregation` clauses or `Fields` for scalar). |
| `gold.sql` | A hand-written reference SQL query the harness executes against the fixture data to produce the expected row multiset. Treated by the harness as a row oracle, not as a SQL-string comparison — D-014 is per-engine, not cross-engine. |

Tests assert on observable behaviour only:

- `expected_error_code: E_<NAME>` ⇒ adapter must surface that code in
  stderr (substring match — see `compliance/harness/src/harness/runner.py`).
- The harness runs both `gold.sql` and the adapter's emitted SQL against
  the shared fixture and compares the resulting row multisets
  (order-insensitive unless the query has an `Order By`).

This means a `gold.sql` is a *witness* of the answer's shape and the
fixture data; the harness never compares SQL strings byte-for-byte
(per D-014, that's a per-engine concern).

## Decision coverage

Every `D-NNN` row in Appendix B of the Foundation spec MUST have at
least one runnable case here. The mapping lives in `decisions.yaml`,
and the runner emits `results/decisions_coverage.md` after every run.
