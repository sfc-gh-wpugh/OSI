"""Off-by-default feature flags for deferred Foundation v0.1 constructs.

`Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md` §10 enumerates a handful of constructs that
the Foundation explicitly defers to the §10 grain-aware-functions
proposal. Their deferred status was sharpened in the latest revision
pass:

* **D-003** — aggregate-bodied fields (same-grain or cross-grain) are
  rejected with ``E_AGGREGATE_IN_FIELD``; all aggregates live in
  model-scoped metrics (§4.5).
* **D-027** — nested aggregation in metric expressions
  (``AVG(COUNT(orders.oid))`` and similar) is rejected with
  ``E_NESTED_AGGREGATION_DEFERRED``; the rules for choosing the inner
  grain wait for §10.
* **§4.5** — per-dataset ``metrics:`` blocks (``customers.metrics:``)
  carry the same implicit "this metric's home dataset is fixed" pin
  as aggregate-bodied fields and are therefore deferred too. Existing
  models port mechanically: move the entry to the top-level
  ``metrics:`` section and qualify the body with the dataset name —
  ``orders.total_revenue = SUM(amount)`` becomes top-level
  ``total_revenue = SUM(orders.amount)``.

The Foundation contract per `Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md` §11 / D-009 is
"engines MAY accept these keys behind a clearly-named, off-by-default
extension flag — a model that uses such a flag is non-portable until
the corresponding deferred proposal lands". This module is that
extension surface for this reference implementation.

Every flag in :class:`FoundationFlags` defaults to ``False``. Calling
``parse_semantic_model(source)`` with no ``flags`` argument therefore
runs the strict Foundation parser; opting back into the legacy
behaviour requires an explicit ``parse_semantic_model(source,
flags=FoundationFlags(allow_aggregate_in_field=True, ...))``.

The flags surface deliberately sits outside :mod:`osi.parsing` so that
later layers (planner, codegen, adapter) can read it without dragging
the entire parsing module.

    """Toggles for features deferred from Foundation v0.1.

    Every flag defaults to ``False``. The ``False`` setting matches
    the strict Foundation as defined in
    ``Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md``; the ``True`` setting opts a model
    or session into the legacy / experimental behaviour for that
    feature, at the cost of portability across compliant engines.

    Flags
    -----
    allow_aggregate_in_field
        D-003. When ``True`` the parser accepts aggregate functions
        inside a field's ``expression`` (the legacy implicit
        home-grain rewrite in :mod:`osi.planning.home_grain` then
        runs). When ``False`` (default) the parser raises
        :class:`~osi.errors.ErrorCode.E_AGGREGATE_IN_FIELD` and the
        author must move the aggregate to a top-level metric.

    allow_dataset_scoped_metrics
        Foundation v0.1 §4.5 deferral. When ``True`` the parser
        accepts a per-dataset ``metrics:`` block under a dataset
        (``customers.metrics: [...]``) and the legacy planner /
        namespace paths consume them. When ``False`` (default) the
        parser raises
        :class:`~osi.errors.ErrorCode.E_DEFERRED_KEY_REJECTED` if any
        dataset declares a ``metrics:`` block.

    allow_nested_aggregation
        D-027. When ``True`` the parser accepts nested aggregation in
        metric expressions (``AVG(COUNT(orders.oid))``, …) and the
        :mod:`osi.planning.planner_nested` two-step planner runs.
        When ``False`` (default) the parser raises
        :class:`~osi.errors.ErrorCode.E_NESTED_AGGREGATION_DEFERRED`
        on the offending metric.
