"""Mid-pipeline bridge resolution for the planner.

This module discharges the bridge route in the Foundation spec
(`Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md` §6.5.1) *without* requiring the bridge
to be the source dataset. The standard planner sources a fact and
walks an `N : 1` enrichment chain to every dimension dataset; when
that chain hits an unsafe edge but a bridge dataset can resolve the
M:N traversal, this module builds an alternative plan shape:

1. ``source(fact)`` and the safe enrichment hops to the bridge's
   left-side link dataset.
2. ``aggregate`` to the bridge's left join-key grain, materialising
   each metric at that grain (distributive aggregates only).
3. ``source(bridge)``, ``enrich`` the right-side target, and
   ``enrich`` the pre-aggregated state in via
   :class:`EnrichDerivedPayload`.
4. ``aggregate`` again at the query's dimension grain, re-aggregating
   each materialised metric with the same operator (``SUM``-of-``SUM``,
   ``MAX``-of-``MAX`` …).

The new plan shape is a pure composition of existing operators —
``source`` + ``enrich`` + ``aggregate`` — so the algebra has nothing
to add. The only new wiring is :class:`EnrichDerivedPayload`, which
lets ``enrich`` accept a derived child rather than a base table.

Restrictions in this version of the reference implementation
(re-examine when real models need more):

* Every metric in the group must be **distributive** (``SUM``,
  ``COUNT``, ``MIN``, ``MAX``). Algebraic (``AVG``) and holistic
  (``COUNT_DISTINCT``) aggregates can't be re-aggregated losslessly
  from a pre-aggregated intermediate, so the planner falls back to
  the original error.
* No composite metrics (`Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md §5.4`). Composites
  must currently use the standard planner shape.
* All query dimensions must reside on the bridge's right-hand side
  (i.e. reachable from the bridge by safe `N : 1` steps). Fact-side
  dimensions would force a wider pre-aggregation grain than this
  version supports.

       This produces one row per bridge tuple with both the inner
       aggregate's argument and the dim columns addressable.
    2. Inner ``aggregate`` at ``(intermediate_keys_dataset.pk ∪
       query_dim_keys)`` with the *inner* aggregate function.
    3. Final ``aggregate`` at the query grain with the *outer*
       aggregate function applied to the inner column.

    Restrictions for v1:

    * Exactly one nested measure in the group (mixed groups still
      route through the standard planner; mixed nested-and-plain is
      rejected as ``E_UNSAFE_REAGGREGATION`` upstream).
    * Both inner and outer functions must be in
      :data:`_BRIDGE_RESOLVABLE` ∪ ``{AVG}``. ``AVG`` is allowed
      because the per-row reading converts ``AVG(AVG(…))`` into a
      sequence of two single-step aggregates, neither of which
      crosses fan-out.
