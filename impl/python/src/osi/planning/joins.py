"""Join-path resolution and cardinality-driven safety checks.

Consumed by :mod:`osi.planning.planner` during query planning. Exposes
two pure helpers over an already-built :class:`RelationshipGraph`:

* :func:`find_enrichment_path` — given a fact root dataset and a set of
  target datasets that need to be joined in (because their dimensions
  or facts are referenced), return a sequence of
  :class:`JoinStep` describing a safe N:1 enrichment chain.
* :func:`assert_m_n_rejected` — inspect every edge on the returned
  path and raise :class:`OSIPlanningError` with
  :attr:`ErrorCode.E3011_MN_AGGREGATION_REJECTED` if any edge is N:N.

Ambiguity surfaces as :attr:`ErrorCode.E3001_AMBIGUOUS_JOIN_PATH`;
unreachable targets as :attr:`ErrorCode.E2004_UNREACHABLE_DATASET`.

This module never produces a :class:`~osi.planning.algebra.state.CalculationState`.
It only returns declarative descriptions the planner then hands to the
algebra operators.
