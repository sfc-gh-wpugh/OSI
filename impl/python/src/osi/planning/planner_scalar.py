"""Scalar query planner branch (D-011).

A scalar query (``Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md §5.1.2``) selects a list of
``fields`` from the home grain of one anchor dataset, with no
``GROUP BY`` and no aggregation. It emits one row per anchor row.

This module owns the scalar shape only. Aggregation queries continue to
flow through :func:`osi.planning.planner.plan`.

Foundation v0.1 rules enforced here:

* **D-011 / E_AGGREGATE_IN_SCALAR_QUERY** — a ``fields`` entry must
  resolve to a dataset field. A reference that resolves to a
  :class:`~osi.planning.resolve.ResolvedMetric` is rejected.
* **D-023 / E_FAN_OUT_IN_SCALAR_QUERY** — every non-anchor field's
  dataset must be reachable from the anchor via an N:1 enrichment chain.
  Any 1:N or N:N edge ⇒ this code. We translate the
  :class:`~osi.planning.joins.find_enrichment_path` ``E3011`` into the
  scalar-specific code so callers can route on intent.
* **D-010 / E_EMPTY_SCALAR_QUERY** — handled by
  :class:`SemanticQuery.__post_init__`.

The anchor is the *first field's dataset*. Order matters: the user
controls which side of the relationship is the "row" of the scalar
result by listing that dataset's field first. This matches the
spec's intent that scalar queries preserve home-grain rows.
