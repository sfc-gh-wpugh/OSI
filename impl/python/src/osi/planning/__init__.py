r"""Layer 2 of the compiler pipeline.

Takes a ``SemanticModel`` + ``SemanticQuery`` and produces a frozen
``QueryPlan`` — an ordered tuple of ``PlanStep``\s, each wrapping a
closed-algebra operator over an immutable ``CalculationState``.

See ``../../../ARCHITECTURE.md`` §3 and
``../../../../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/JOIN_ALGEBRA.md`` for the
algebra contract.
