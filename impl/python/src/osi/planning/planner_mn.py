"""M:N resolution helpers for the planner.

Carved out of :mod:`osi.planning.planner` so the entry-point file
stays under the LOC cap. Everything here is :pep:`8` private to the
package — only re-exported via ``__all__`` so the planner can import
the small set of symbols it needs without re-exposing the whole
module.

Three concerns live here:

* ``Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md §6.5.1`` bridge anchor discovery for
  dimension-only queries (:func:`find_bridge_anchors`,
  :func:`build_dimension_only_group`).
* ``§6.5.2`` multi-fact stitch validation
  (:func:`validate_multi_fact_stitch`).
* ``§6.7`` per-metric ``using_relationships`` intersection
  (:func:`group_allowed_relationships`).

Pure functions over already-resolved planner inputs; no SQL is
generated and no algebra steps are emitted. Errors raised here are
the ``E3001`` / ``E3013`` family the spec mandates.
