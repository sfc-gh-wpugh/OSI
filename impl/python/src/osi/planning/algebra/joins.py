"""Grain-matching join operators: ``merge`` and ``filtering_join``.

Extracted from :mod:`osi.planning.algebra.operations` to keep the
per-file line budget (``INFRA.md §1.2``, 600 lines). Everything here is
still part of the closed algebra and shares the same contract:

* pure, total, deterministic;
* never mutates its inputs;
* raises :class:`AlgebraError` with a stable :class:`ErrorCode` on any
  precondition failure.

Mutation-score target: **≥ 90%** (same as ``operations.py``). A
surviving mutation in these functions is a P0 bug.
