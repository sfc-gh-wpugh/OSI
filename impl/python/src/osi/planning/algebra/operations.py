"""Five of the nine operators of the closed algebra.

This module hosts ``source``, ``filter_``, ``enrich``, ``aggregate``,
and ``project``. The two grain-matching joins — ``merge`` and
``filtering_join`` — live in :mod:`osi.planning.algebra.joins`; the
two scalar-composition operators — ``add_columns`` and ``broadcast``
— live in :mod:`osi.planning.algebra.composition`. The split keeps
each file inside the 600-line per-file budget (``INFRA.md §1.2``);
all nine operators share the same contract and are re-exported
through :mod:`osi.planning.algebra`.

Every compiler transformation is expressed as a composition of these
nine operators. Adding a tenth is a SPEC change (see
``../../../../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/JOIN_ALGEBRA.md §3``).

Mutation-score target: **≥ 90%** for this module (``INFRA.md §1.1``). A
surviving mutation here is a P0 bug — it means at least one property or
unit test is weaker than it looks.

Convention: every operator returns a *new* :class:`CalculationState`;
the input is never mutated. Preconditions are checked before any work;
failures raise :class:`AlgebraError` with a specific :class:`ErrorCode`
(``E3xxx`` for shape/grain contract violations, ``E4xxx`` for
algebra-only safety failures — see :class:`AlgebraError`).

    proving that every column the predicate reads is addressable.

    safety from grain, *not* from a caller-asserted boolean.

    Preconditions
    -------------

      can have multiple rows per join key, joining duplicates
      ``parent`` rows and silently destroys ``parent.grain``. The
      check delegates to
      :meth:`CalculationState.is_unique_on`, which accepts any
      ``child_keys`` set that is a superset of either the child's
      grain or any declared :attr:`unique_key`. ``Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md
      §6.1`` mandates this symmetric treatment so authors can recover
      from a wider-than-necessary PK declaration with an explicit UK
      on the join column. Failures raise
      :attr:`ErrorCode.E3011_MN_AGGREGATION_REJECTED` (semantically a
      fan trap; the same code covers the wider ``N:N`` case).

      reduction) collides with a parent column
    * no child column is an aggregate (aggregates are built by
      :func:`aggregate` after the join, not before)

    ``drop_child_columns`` lets the planner skip child columns that are
    redundant — typically the child-side join keys when they share a
    name with the parent-side keys. The Foundation algebra does not
    rename: collisions outside this drop set surface as
