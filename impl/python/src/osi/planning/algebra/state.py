"""Immutable value types that flow through the closed algebra.

See ``../../../../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/JOIN_ALGEBRA.md §1`` for
the normative contract. Nothing in this file imports from
``osi.parsing`` or ``osi.codegen``; those layers see algebra values but
never construct them directly. Construction happens only through
:func:`osi.planning.algebra.operations.source` (and its downstream
operator chain).

Invariants (see ``ARCHITECTURE.md §6``):

* **I-1** ``grain ⊆ {c.name for c in columns if c.kind is DIMENSION}``
* **I-2** column names in ``columns`` are unique
* **I-5** ``grain == frozenset()`` implies scalar (one row)
* **I-6** ``column.dependencies ⊆ {other.name for other in columns}``
* **I-8** ``provenance`` grows only through operators that serve a
  requested expression
* **I-9** every set in ``unique_keys`` is non-empty and a subset of
  the dimension column names; ``unique_keys`` are *alternative*
  minimum keys at the current grain (the grain itself is always a
  key — see :meth:`CalculationState.is_unique_on`)

Violations are always raised as :class:`AlgebraError` (``E4xxx``) from
the operator that produced the state, never silently tolerated.
