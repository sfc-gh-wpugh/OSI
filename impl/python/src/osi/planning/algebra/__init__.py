"""The closed algebra — the correctness boundary of the compiler.

All compiler transformations must compose operators from this module.
See ``../../../../docs/JOIN_ALGEBRA.md`` (the
authoritative spec) for operator signatures, preconditions, grain
contracts, and laws.

The nine operators and their current planner wiring:

- :func:`source` — initialize from a dataset. *Emitted for every leaf.*
- :func:`filter_` — apply a row-level predicate (underscored; ``filter``
  is a Python builtin). *Emitted for row-level ``WHERE`` and for
  ``HAVING``.*
- :func:`enrich` — N:1 join that preserves parent grain. *Emitted for
  every safe single-hop or multi-hop enrichment step.*
- :func:`aggregate` — coarsen to a target grain. *Emitted once per
  measure group.*
- :func:`project` — keep only the named columns. *Emitted once at the
  root.*
- :func:`add_columns` — introduce derived scalar columns. *Emitted only
  for composite metrics (Foundation spec §5.4).*
- :func:`merge` — full-outer chasm-safe join at matching grain.
  *Emitted when two measure groups with different fact datasets must
  be combined (Foundation spec §4.11).*
- :func:`filtering_join` — semi-/anti-semi-join for ``EXISTS_IN``.
  *Emitted for ``EXISTS_IN`` predicates in ``WHERE``.*
- :func:`broadcast` — attach a scalar column. **Reserved.** The
  operator and its ``BROADCAST`` plan step exist so the algebra stays
  closed under nine operators, but today's planner never emits it —
  scalar-per-row calculations go through composite metrics. The
  operator's ``E4004_BROADCAST_NOT_SCALAR`` precondition is still
  covered by unit tests so a future sprint can turn on the planner
  path without destabilising the algebra.

Mutation-score target: ≥ 90% (``INFRA.md §1.1``). A surviving mutation
in this module is a P0.
