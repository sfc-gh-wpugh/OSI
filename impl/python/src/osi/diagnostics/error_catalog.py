"""Per-error-code prose explanations.

Each :class:`~osi.errors.ErrorCode` has exactly one entry here, with a
one-paragraph explanation, the spec section it implements, and (where
applicable) the rewrite the user should consider. The Foundation
contract is that *every* code in the enum has an entry — the
``test_error_catalog_explanations`` test enforces this so a new error
code cannot land without a docstring.

Consumers:

* CLI ``osi explain <code>`` (future).
* Compliance suite reporters that want a human-readable cause column.
* Internal debugging — ``from osi.diagnostics.error_catalog import
  explain_error`` is the canonical lookup.

This module deliberately does NOT format messages — those are produced
at the raise site with the relevant context. This module explains the
*class* of error.
