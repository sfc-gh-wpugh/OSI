"""Shared pytest fixtures for the OSI Python reference implementation.

Fixtures live here rather than per-layer so that property tests, unit
tests, golden tests, and E2E tests can all share the same generation
strategies and DuckDB harness.

Phase 0 scaffolding: keep this file small. Richer fixtures (DuckDB
engines, golden snapshot helpers) are added in later phases.
