"""Appendix C ↔ ``ErrorCode`` drift test (Phase 3 review B5 + I1).

The Foundation spec's Appendix C of
``../../../proposals/foundation-v0.1/Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md``
is the normative list of error codes a Foundation engine may raise.
This test pins both sides of the contract so the implementation and
the spec cannot drift silently:

1. Every Appendix-C code (``E_*`` family, plus the kept ``E3xxx``
   numeric codes) must exist as an :class:`ErrorCode` enum member with
   the same ``code.value`` string. Without this, a conformance test
   that asserts ``error.code == "E_AMBIGUOUS_MEASURE_GRAIN"`` could
   never trigger.
2. Every ``ErrorCode`` enum member whose name starts with ``E_`` (the
   spec's named family) must either appear in Appendix C *or* be
   explicitly listed in :data:`_IMPLEMENTATION_EXTENSIONS` below with
   a one-line rationale, so reviewers know which codes are spec-
   mandated and which are implementation extensions.

When updating the spec, update :data:`_APPENDIX_C_CODES` first; the
test will fail until the enum is in sync.
