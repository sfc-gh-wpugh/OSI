"""Hypothesis strategies shared by every property test.

Per ``docs/ALGEBRA_LAWS.md §1``: strategies are deliberately minimal —
just enough to exercise the algebra without drifting into scenarios the
Foundation does not support.

Landed so far:

* ``identifiers()`` — syntactically valid, non-reserved identifiers
* ``dimension_sets()`` — small grain sets
* ``dimension_columns()`` / ``fact_columns()`` — individual columns
* ``states()`` — valid :class:`CalculationState`, built through
  :func:`osi.planning.algebra.source` so every generated state is
  reachable via the algebra

Strategies that require running SQL against DuckDB (e.g.
``duckdb_fixtures()``) land alongside Phase 4 codegen.

# Tokens we never want Hypothesis to feed into a SQL builder. Two
# disjoint groups:
#
# * **OSI internal sentinels** — names the algebra reserves for grain /
#   provenance / wildcard handling; ``normalize_identifier`` already
#   refuses them, so generating them here would just be a wasted draw.
# * **SQL reserved words** in the dialects we currently target (ANSI,
#   DuckDB, Snowflake). The shape regex above happily produces tokens
#   like ``in`` / ``as`` / ``or`` / ``on`` because they match
#   ``[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,15}``. When such a token leaks through and is
#   later concatenated into a SQL string by another strategy
#   (notably :func:`aggregate_column`, which builds ``SUM(<over>)``),
#   sqlglot raises a ``ParseError`` and the whole property test
#   fails with what looks like an unrelated crash.
#
# Filtering at the strategy level is sufficient because every column /
# expression strategy below either (a) runs the identifier through
# :func:`_frozen_col_ref` (which quotes) or (b) builds the AST
# programmatically with ``quoted=True``. Production code is *not*
# protected by this list — ``normalize_identifier`` accepts SQL
# keywords today; if you want to close that gap, fix it at the
# parser / codegen layer rather than mirroring the keyword list here.

    1. **Reserved-word leakage** — even though we wrapped the name in

       to parse generated names like ``in`` or ``as`` as keyword
       tokens before recognising the quoting context. Skipping the

    2. **Dialect-default quote style** — ``"foo"`` is portable today

       backticks. ``quoted=True`` lets sqlglot pick the right style at
