## Overview

![][image1]

There are two layers in OSI that need an expression language:

* **Ontology layer.**  This layer maps onto the ontology layer which sits above the logical layer.  It maps more closely to modelling languages like OWL, [(Py)Rel](https://docs.relational.ai) from RelationalAI, and [Legend](https://legend.finos.org) from Goldman Sachs  
* **Logical layer.**  This layer maps directly to the databases and physical layer.  It maps closely to traditional BI semantic models.

This proposal is only targeted at the Logical Layer.  It would be nice if the Ontological layer could re-use the same expression language, but that will be treated as a separate proposal.

This document defines the SQL expression language subset that OSI-compliant implementations MUST support. The goal is to provide a portable expression language that works across all OSI implementations while allowing vendors to expose richer database-specific functionality through dialect extensions.

We expect there will be extensions to this language to cover concepts such as sub-queries, grain calculations, etc.  However, these will each have their own proposal.

### Design Principles

1. **Portability**: Core functions work identically across all implementations  
2. **Familiarity**: Based on widely-adopted SQL syntax and semantics  
3. **Analytical Focus**: Prioritizes functions commonly used in BI and analytics  
4. **Extensibility**: Vendor dialects can extend beyond the core

### Changes to YAML

1) Create a new dialect in the OSI spec: OSI\_SQL\_2026, which refers to this language specification.   
2) Make OSI\_SQL\_2026 the default dialect if one is not chosen.

### Standards Reference

The core language is based on **ANSI SQL:2003 Core** (ISO/IEC 9075-2:2003), selected for its:

- Wide adoption across major databases (Snowflake, Databricks, PostgreSQL, BigQuery)  
- Well-defined semantics  
- Support for modern analytical features (window functions, CTEs)

### Namespacing and Identifier Resolution

The identifiers will match standard SQL identifiers:

`Field: <SQL Identifier>`

`FieldExpr: Field | Field ‘.’ Field`

The OSI spec currently contains three namespaces, which determine the visibility and uniqueness of each value.  Where and how a field (or metric) is defined will determine the namespace for it, which in turn determines the ways it can be addressed by other fields.

All identifiers MUST be valid names and follow ANSI SQL naming, with the size limitation of 128 characters for identifiers.  Many databases support longer identifiers, however, this number is safe for a broad number of vendors.

Regular identifiers (unquoted) should be case insensitive.    For example, an identifier id is regular, so it would match with Id or iD.  Comparing quoted and non-quoted identifiers is DB specific, so for best portability it is best to use simple identifiers.

The quote character for the OSI dialect will follow ANSI SQL and support the double quote character (“).  This means that if an expression is in a field expression or as an identifier in the YAML, this will be the expected quoting.  However, there are some databases that use other escape characters.  Working with these have the option of either creating expressions using their dialect or having the OSI document written in the OSI dialect, but then having the SQL Interface queried in the local dialect.  The SQL Interface will be defined in a different document. 

#### Comparison Table

| You type this in SQL | Database sees it as... | Will it match a column created as id? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| id | ID | **Yes** (Standard behavior) |
| Id | ID | **Yes** (Standard behavior) |
| "ID" | ID | **Yes** (Force-matched to normalized case) |
| "id" | id | **No** (Database is looking for lowercase) |

Sometimes, we may refer to a **normalized identifier**.  This is a form the identifiers can be put in, so they can be matched easily and matches can be made with case-sensitive, exact matching.  For **normalized identifiers**:

* Regular identifiers are upper cased  
* Quoted identifiers have their quotes stripped and any escaped characters are unescaped

#### Name Spaces

Namespaces define how an identifier is looked up in an expression.  The identifier rules above determine how to create a normalized name, and the namespace determines whether those normalized names resolve to the same objects.

There are three scopes which make up our namespace, with membership in each determined by where the field was defined: **Global**, **Dataset** and **Physical**.

##### Global Scope

Objects that are defined at the top level of the semantic model are in the Global scope.  These are from expressions without any qualifier, and can be accessed from anywhere (although other rules like grain rules still apply in how they can be used).  

In the current OSI spec, the only global scoped fields are Metrics, Datasets and Relationships.  However, in the future there could be other sections.  Regardless of the heading the fields are defined in, any of those top level fields share in the same namespace, and should not be able to have the same normalized names.

The Global Metrics have access to global and object fields, but NOT physical fields.  In order to access a physical field, it MUST be pulled in through a dataset field.  

Relationships have access to global, object and physical fields (since, they can be useful for defining joins).  

Accessing an object field MUST be qualified with the name of the object in order to reference the field.  E.g. store\_sales.id would reference the ID field in the STORE\_SALES object.

##### Dataset / Object

The object scope is unique to the object the fields are defined in.  Currently, the only objects that have nested fields are Datasets.  They have a fields section to define new fields.

Fields may be defined at the dataset level.  Their identifiers MUST be unique within the dataset, but can have the same name as identifiers in other datasets, or in the global scope.

**Object fields can access logical or physical fields** within the object’s scope without requiring qualification.  The fields may also access global fields as well, which means that shadowing can occur here.  To handle these in a predictable way, names will be resolved with the following rules:

| Precedence | Field Type | Disambiguation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Highest | Physical Fields | N/A |
| Middle | Logical fields on the object | Qualifying access through the object name, will ensure getting a logical field, rather than the shadowing physical field. store\_sales.id will ensure access to the logical id field, not the physical one. |
| Lowest | Global fields or objects | Unable to access a shadowed global field.  E.g. if there is a global field sales and the object scope has a sales field, then the local sales will shadow the global one. |

##### Physical

Physical fields are ones that come directly from the Dataset’s source query.  They are not directly stored in the model, but reflect what is in the actual system of record.

Physical fields are ONLY accessible from Dataset fields. 

There is no way to create Physical fields.

## SQL Language Subset

### Supported SQL Constructs

OSI expressions support the following SQL constructs within metric and filter expressions:

| Construct | Notes |
| :---- | :---- |
| Column and Metric references | Varies based on whether in Ontology or Semantic models. See namespaceing in [OSI Discussion Point: Core Analytic Abstractions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1si8DqU4arG18ZgX4HnRG5D_zS2X7V1s-vgNY35rvxhM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.le505t8uoyfy) And future Ontology documentation |

## Aggregation Functions

All aggregation functions operate on the effective grain of the metric.

### Core Aggregation Functions (REQUIRED)

| Function | Syntax | Description | Decomposability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `SUM` | `SUM(expr)` | Sum of values | Distributive |
| `COUNT` | `COUNT(expr)` | Count of non-null values | Distributive |
| `COUNT(*)` | `COUNT(*)` | Count of all rows | Distributive |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT expr)` | `COUNT(DISTINCT expr)` | Count of distinct values | Holistic |
| `AVG` | `AVG(expr)` | Arithmetic mean | Algebraic |
| `MIN` | `MIN(expr)` | Minimum value | Distributive |
| `MAX` | `MAX(expr)` | Maximum value | Distributive |

### Statistical Aggregations (REQUIRED)

| Function | Syntax | Description | Decomposability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `STDDEV` | `STDDEV(expr)` | Sample standard deviation | Algebraic |
| `STDDEV_POP` | `STDDEV_POP(expr)` | Population standard deviation | Algebraic |
| `STDDEV_SAMP` | `STDDEV_SAMP(expr)` | Sample standard deviation (alias for STDDEV) | Algebraic |
| `VARIANCE` | `VARIANCE(expr)` | Sample variance | Algebraic |
| `VAR_POP` | `VAR_POP(expr)` | Population variance | Algebraic |
| `VAR_SAMP` | `VAR_SAMP(expr)` | Sample variance (alias for VARIANCE) | Algebraic |

### Percentile Functions (REQUIRED — parseable surface; Foundation planner support is limited)

| Function | Syntax | Description | Decomposability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `MEDIAN` | `MEDIAN(expr)` | Median value (50th percentile) | Holistic |
| `PERCENTILE_CONT` | `PERCENTILE_CONT(p) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY expr)` | Continuous percentile (interpolated) | Holistic |
| `PERCENTILE_DISC` | `PERCENTILE_DISC(p) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY expr)` | Discrete percentile (actual value) | Holistic |

Where `p` is a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.5 for median, 0.75 for 75th percentile).

> **Foundation v0.1 status.** These functions are part of the
> OSI_SQL_2026 *parseable* surface (so any tooling that lints, formats,
> or re-emits an expression keeps it intact), but
> [`Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md` §10](Proposed_OSI_Semantics.md#10-deferred)
> defers the ordered-set form `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY …)` from the
> Foundation Tier, and a conforming planner MUST reject all
> holistic percentile/median aggregates as top-level metric expressions
> with `E1208_UNSUPPORTED_SQL_CONSTRUCT` (see Appendix C). They will
> become first-class once the dedicated grain-aware-functions
> proposal lands.

### Approximate Aggregations (RECOMMENDED)

Approximate functions trade exact accuracy for significantly better performance on large datasets. They use probabilistic algorithms (sketches) that are efficiently mergeable, making them well-suited for distributed computation.

| Function | Syntax | Description | Typical Error |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` | `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(expr)` | Approximate distinct count using HyperLogLog or something similar.  Actual method is up to providers. | \~2% |
| `APPROX_PERCENTILE` | `APPROX_PERCENTILE(expr, p)` | Approximate percentile using t-digest or similar | \~1% |

```sql
-- Approximate distinct count (much faster than COUNT(DISTINCT) on large data)
APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(customer_id)

-- Approximate median
APPROX_PERCENTILE(amount, 0.5)

-- Approximate 95th percentile  
APPROX_PERCENTILE(response_time, 0.95)
```

**Database Support:**

| Function | Snowflake | BigQuery | Databricks | PostgreSQL |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (extension) |
| `APPROX_PERCENTILE` | ✅ | ✅ `APPROX_QUANTILES` | ✅ | ❌ |

**Note**: BigQuery uses `APPROX_QUANTILES(expr, num_buckets)` which returns an array. To get a specific percentile: `APPROX_QUANTILES(amount, 100)[OFFSET(50)]` for median.

**When to use approximate functions:**

- Large datasets (millions+ rows) where exact results aren't critical  
- Interactive dashboards where response time matters  
- Exploratory analysis where directional accuracy is sufficient

---

### Conditional Aggregations (REQUIRED)

SUM / COUNT aggregation functions support `DISTINCT.`   
All aggregations should support filtered aggregation:

```sql
-- DISTINCT modifier
SUM(DISTINCT amount)
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)

-- Filtered aggregation via CASE
SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)
COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 END)
```

### Decomposability Reference

For multi-stage aggregation (see [OSI Analytical Context Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MKNySGmEv_C6CzBZ7um9Ym3_mMvmOolpDuwPvRzQ1bo/edit?usp=sharing)):

| Category | Functions |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Distributive** | SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX |
| **Algebraic** | AVG, STDDEV, VARIANCE |
| **Holistic** | MEDIAN, PERCENTILE, COUNT DISTINCT |
| **Sketch-based** | APPROX\_COUNT\_DISTINCT, APPROX\_PERCENTILE |

Approximate functions are naturally suited for multi-stage aggregation because their sketch data structures are designed to be mergeable.

### Null-Safe Comparison

```sql
-- Standard comparison (returns NULL if either side is NULL)
a = b

-- Null-safe comparison (treats NULLs as equal)
a IS NOT DISTINCT FROM b    -- TRUE if both are NULL
a IS DISTINCT FROM b        -- TRUE if one is NULL and other isn't
```

## Dialect Extensions

OSI implementations MAY support additional functions through dialect-specific extensions. When using dialect extensions, the expression must specify the dialect.

The OSI dialect should always be supported.  Other dialects MAY be ignored.  There is no guarantee that all different dialects for an expression will act the same, so implementations should be consistent with their dialect handling.

### Declaring Dialect-Specific Expressions

```
expression:
  dialects:
    - dialect: ANSI_SQL
      expression: DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
    - dialect: SNOWFLAKE
      expression: DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
    - dialect: BIGQUERY
      expression: DATE_TRUNC(order_date, MONTH)
```

### Common Dialect Variations

| Function | ANSI\_SQL | Snowflake | BigQuery | Databricks | PostgreSQL |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Date truncation | `DATE_TRUNC('month', d)` | `DATE_TRUNC('month', d)` | `DATE_TRUNC(d, MONTH)` | `DATE_TRUNC('month', d)` | `DATE_TRUNC('month', d)` |
| Date add | `DATEADD(day, 7, d)` | `DATEADD(day, 7, d)` | `DATE_ADD(d, INTERVAL 7 DAY)` | `DATE_ADD(d, 7)` | `d + INTERVAL '7 days'` |
| String concat | `CONCAT(a, b)` | `CONCAT(a, b)` | `CONCAT(a, b)` | `CONCAT(a, b)` | `a || b` |
| Null coalesce | `COALESCE(a, b)` | `COALESCE(a, b)` or `NVL(a, b)` | `COALESCE(a, b)` or `IFNULL(a, b)` | `COALESCE(a, b)` | `COALESCE(a, b)` |
| Current timestamp | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` |
| Substring | `SUBSTRING(s, start, len)` | `SUBSTR(s, start, len)` | `SUBSTR(s, start, len)` | `SUBSTRING(s, start, len)` | `SUBSTRING(s, start, len)` |

### Dialect-Specific Extensions

Vendors may expose their own feature through extensions, however the default for OSI should be to pass unknown values through.:

## Compliance Levels

### MUST Support (Core)

Implementations MUST support all functions marked as **REQUIRED** in this specification. These represent the minimum portable expression language.

### SHOULD Support (Recommended)

Implementations SHOULD support functions marked as **RECOMMENDED**. These are common analytical functions that may not be available in all databases.

### MAY Support (Extensions)

Implementations MAY support additional functions through dialect extensions. These should be documented as dialect-specific.
